# Project Setup Skill

This skill bridges the gap between your planned task list and GitHub's issue tracking system. It reads a Markdown file (e.g., generated by `task-manager`), parses the phases and weeks, and automatically sets up your GitHub repository.

## Capabilities

1.  **Parse Task List**: Reads a markdown file structured with `## Phase` and `### Week` headers.
2.  **Create Milestones**: Converts each `Phase` into a GitHub Milestone.
3.  **Create Issues**: Converts each `Week` (or task group) into a GitHub Issue, linked to the corresponding Milestone.
4.  **Add Task Lists**: Adds the detailed checkbox items as a task list within the GitHub Issue body.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
1.  Ensure `gh` CLI is authenticated (`gh auth status`).
2.  Have a target repository ready.
3.  Have a task list markdown file (e.g., `PROJECT_TODO.md`).

### Usage
Run the python script with the path to your task list and the target repository.

```bash
python3 ~/Skills/project-setup/scripts/sync_to_github.py --file "PROJECT_TODO.md" --repo "username/repo-name"
```
